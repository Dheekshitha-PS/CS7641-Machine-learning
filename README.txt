How to run
There are two files each for two data inside Code folder. The code can be run by clicking on restart and run all in the jupyter notebook
For data1
Fake news classifier Neural network iterations.ipynb- has code for neural network
Fake news classfier.ipynb-- has code for all the other models

For data2
Data 2Neural Network iterations.ipynb - has code for neural network

Data2 Customer churn prediction models.ipynb-- has code for all the other models
